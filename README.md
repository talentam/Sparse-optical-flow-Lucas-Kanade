# Sparse-optical-flow
This code implemented pyramidal Lucas Kanade optical flow algorithm. "Pyramidal Implementation of the Lucas Kanade Feature Tracker
Description of the algorithm" written by Jean-Yves Bouguet was used for reference. Also, a simple GUI to allow pedestrian detection and manually selected point tracking was implemented. Just run the GUI-entry.py and play with the program :)
