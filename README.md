# Sparse-optical-flow
This code implemented pyramidal Lucas Kanade optical flow algorithm without directly calling the OpenCV LK fucntion. "Pyramidal Implementation of the Lucas Kanade Feature Tracker Description of the algorithm" written by Jean-Yves Bouguet was used for reference. Also, a simple GUI to allow pedestrian detection and manually selected point tracking was implemented. Just run the GUI-entry.py and play with the program :)
